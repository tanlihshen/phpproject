   <h6>Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula. With an estimated 94.6 million inhabitants as of 2016, it is the world's 15th-most-populous country, and the ninth-most-populous Asian country. Vietnam is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest, and the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast.[n 5] Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976, with Ho Chi Minh City as the most populous city. Thereafter, Vietnam was divided politically into two rival states, North Vietnam (officially the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) and South Vietnam (officially the Republic of Vietnam). Vietnam is divided into 58 provinces ( in Vietnamese: tỉnh), and there are 5 centrally-controlled municipalities existing at the same level as provinces: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Can Tho, Da Nang and Hai Phong.
