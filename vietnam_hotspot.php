			<h2> Vietnam's Attractions & Hotspots </h2>
			<br>
			      <ol>
				  <li><h4>Ha Long Bay </h4>
				  <img src = "images/halong.jpg" alt = "halong image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>Ha Long Bay is situated in north Vietnam round a 120 kilometer long coast line and is literally translated as “Bay of Descending Dragons”. The top tourist attraction in Vietnam, Ha Long Bay features thousands of islands, each topped with thick jungle vegetation, forming a spectacular seascape of limestone pillars. Several of the islands are hollow, with enormous caves, others islands include lakes and some support floating villages of fishermen.</p>
				  
				  <li><h4>Hoi An</h4>
				  <img src = "images/hoian.jpg" alt = "hoian image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
                  <p>This fishing-village-turned-tourist-attraction is situated on the coast of the South China Sea. Hoi An has been an international port from the 16th century although the serious shipping business has long since moved to the city of Da Nang. The heart of the city is still the Old Town, full of winding lanes and Chinese-styled shops. It is sometimes called the “Venice of Vietnam” because of the narrow canals that cut through part of the town.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Phu Quoc</h4>
				  <img src = "images/phuquoc.jpg" alt = "phuquoc image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>Located in front of the Cambodia coast, Phu Quoc is the largest island in Vietnam. Phu Quoc is what Phuket would be if it hadn’t been overrun by development. The island features pristine tropical forests, undamaged coral reefs and great beaches. One of its beaches, named Bai Dai (Long Beach), was chosen by the ABC News as one of five beautiful and clean beaches. Phu Quoc is famous for producing the best nuoc mam or fermented fish sauce in the world.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Sa Pa Terraces</h4>
				  <img src = "images/sapa.jpg" alt = "sapa image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>Sa Pa is a town in northwest Vietnam not far from the Chinese border. Rice terraces can be found in the Muong Hoa valley between Sa Pa town and the Fansipan Mountain, on a backdrop of thick bamboo woodlands. Local mountain people, the Hmong, Giay, Dao, Tay, and Giay, grow rice and corn on these paddy terraces, along with vegetables.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Mui Ne</h4>
				  <img src = "images/muine.jpg" alt = "muine image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>The formerly little-inhabited beach south of the fishing village of Mui Ne has seen some serious development in the last 15 years. Due to strong sea breezes it is a popular destination in Vietnam for kite- and windsurfing. No trip to Mui Ne is complete without a trip to the famous sand dunes located a short distance north of the town. The vast sandy expanse provide some great panoramic views especially during sunset.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Mekong Delta</h4>
				  <img src = "images/mekong.jpg" alt = "mekong image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>The Mekong Delta is the region in southern Vietnam where the Mekong River approaches and empties into the sea. It is a very rich and lush area, covered with rice fields, that produces about half of the total of Vietnam’s agricultural output. Subsequently, life in the Mekong Delta revolves much around the river, and all the villages are often accessible by river rather than by road.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Cu Chi Tunnels</h4>
				  <img src = "images/cuchi.jpg" alt = "cuchi image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>The Cu Chi Tunnels are an immense network of connecting underground tunnels located about 40 km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). The tunnels were used by Viet Cong guerrillas as hiding spots during the Vietnam War, and were the base of operations for the Tết Offensive in 1968. The tunnels have become a popular tourist attraction, and visitors are invited to crawl around in the safer parts of the tunnel system.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Nha Trang</h4>
				  <img src = "images/nhatrang.jpg" alt = "nhatrang image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>Nha Trang is Vietnam’s most popular seaside resort town located along the second most beautiful bays in the country. It features beautiful beaches with fine and clean sand and clear ocean water with mild temperatures. The city has about 300,000 inhabitants and is more lively and urban in character than other beach destinations like Mui Ne and Phu Quoc. It’s also the scuba diving center of Vietnam.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Phong Nha Caves</h4>
				  <img src = "images/phongnha.jpg" alt = "phongnha image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park boasts many attractions, but none is so popular as its caves. The Phong Nha Caves are made up of hundreds of cave systems, many of which are large enough to hold entire city blocks. The biggest, and most notable, is Hang Son Doong. A gateway to the caves is Son Trach, a growing village that is home to several transport links throughout Vietnam, local restaurants and meeting points for guided tours to the caves.’s not very big but packs a wallop for its size. Travelers can see wildlife, rainforests, tumbling waterfalls, beaches and sea stacks. The biggest attraction in the park is the bizarre, obscene-nosed proboscis monkey, though they are rare and difficult to spot. It also has great nature trails, from easy strolls to full-day hikes through the jungle, so all visitors should be able to find one that suits them.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>My Son</h4>
				  <img src = "images/myson.jpg" alt = "myson image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>More than 1,600 years ago, the Chan people of Vietnam began construction on dozens of Hindu temples near the village of Duy Phú. Under the shadow of Cat’s Tooth Mountain, and surrounded by a green valley, several of these temples still stand. Known collectively as My Son, most of the temples are now ruins. However, that only adds to the atmosphere. Visiting My Son is like stepping back in time, thanks in part to its secluded location and the lack of touristy infrastructure.</p>
