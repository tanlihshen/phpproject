			<h2> Thailand's Attractions & Hotspots </h2>
			<br>
			      <ol>
				  <li><h4>Floating Markets </h4>
				  <img src = "images/floating.jpg" alt = "floating image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>To get an idea of what shopping in Bangkok used to be like before all the canals were filled in, many people visiting the capital take a day trip to one of the floating markets outside the city. Though today floating markets typically function as tourist attractions and community meeting places rather than vital aspects of local farming economies, they still remain vibrant places brimming with scrumptious food. The most popular floating market for foreign tourists is Damnoen Saduak while most Thai favor the Amphawa Floating Market.</p>
				  
				  <li><h4>Hua Hin Beach</h4>
				  <img src = "images/huahin.jpg" alt = "huahin image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
                  <p>Originally, built in the 1920s as a royal getaway for King Rama VII, Hua Hin has been a long-time favorite weekend getaway for Bangkok residents. Today, the 8 km (5 mile) long beach is also popular with tourists. Hua Hin is the site of the Klai Kangwon Palace, which is still used by Thai royalty today. In addition it is home to the highest concentration of golf courses in all of Thailand.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Prasat Hin Phimai</h4>
				  <img src = "images/prasathin.jpg" alt = "prasathin image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>Prasat Hin Phimai boasts some of the most impressive Khmer ruins in Thailand. Similar in style (if much smaller) than those at Angkor, the temples were built during the 11th and 12th century, during which time the area was part of the Khmer empire. Though built as a Mahayana Buddhist temple, the carvings also feature many Hindu deities as explained in the visitor center.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Mu Ko Ang Thong</h4>
				  <img src = "images/muko.jpg" alt = "muko image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>Ang Thong, which means “Bowl of Gold,” is a popular national park in the Gulf of Thailand. Consisting of 42 islands, which are close together for easy island hopping, the park is headquartered on Ko Wua Talap. There, travelers can stay in lovely bungalows and take in incredible views of the surrounding islands and bizarre rock formations. Exploring the island’s white sand beaches and snorkeling among the shallow coral gardens makes a popular day trip from Ko Samui.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Sukhothai Historical Park</h4>
				  <img src = "images/sukhothai.jpg" alt = "sukhothai image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>Located in northern Thailand, Sukhothai Historical Park contains the ruins of Sukhothai, which was the capital of the kingdom of the same name during the 13th and 14th centuries. Roughly translating to mean “Dawn of Happiness,” the walled-in park contains nearly 200 sets of ruins, including 26 temples and the Royal Palace. In addition to exploring the many fascinating wats and other ruins, visitors can learn more about the Sukhothai culture at the Ramkhamhaeng National Museum.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Ko Nang Yuan</h4>
				  <img src = "images/konangyuan.jpg" alt = "konangyuan image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>Ko Nang Yuan is a tiny island very close to Ko Tao. It is a popular day trip from Ko Tao, so its beautiful beaches can be crowded at times. But it’s a pretty island and its clear waters are perfect for snorkeling and scuba diving. To visit this island, travelers who are not staying on Ko Nang Yuan must pay a 100 baht fee. The island does have one dive resort for travelers who prefer to stay on this small island.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Wat Arun</h4>
				  <img src = "images/watarun.jpg" alt = "watarun image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>The name of this lavishly adorned temple roughly translates to mean “Temple of Dawn,” which is fitting as it was built to honor Aruna, the Hindu god that is most commonly represented by the radiations of the rising sun. Located in the Bangkok Yai district on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River, Wat Arun’s distinctive prang, or spires, are lavishly adorned with colorful patterns of seashells and porcelain. The central prang rises more than 85 meters (280 feet) high.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Chiang Mai Night Market</h4>
				  <img src = "images/chiangmai.jpg" alt = "chiangmai image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>The famous Night Bazaar in Chiang Mai sprawls along several city blocks along footpaths, inside buildings and temple grounds. It has handicrafts, arts, clothing and and imported products of all descriptions, and a number of large, well-appointed modern shopping centers. At first, the market was owned by Chinese merchants, but since it grew in size as more commercial buildings were built, it was no longer owned by a single group of people. Instead, there are many owners, and most of them are Thai.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Ko Lipe</h4>
				  <img src = "images/kolipe.jpg" alt = "kolipe image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>Located in the Andaman Sea off the Satun Province, Koh Lipe is a tiny island near the Malaysian border. Small enough to be covered by foot within about an hour, Koh Lipe boasts four gorgeous beaches whose waters are home to about 25 percent of the world’s fish species. Coral reefs attract snorkelers and scuba divers, and travelers can stay in beach bungalows in different sizes.</p>
				  
                  <li><h4>Similan Islands</h4>
				  <img src = "images/similan.jpg" alt = "similan image" width = "70%" height = "70%">
				  </li>
				  <p>Made up of nine primary islands and two far-flung ones, the Similan Islands archipelago is one of the most popular diving destinations in the country. Situated off the coast of the Phang Nga Province in southern Thailand, the waters surrounding the islands boast gorgeous coral reefs and underwater rock formations that take on many unique shapes. Experienced divers particularly enjoy hot spots like East of Eden and Elephant Head Rock.</p>
