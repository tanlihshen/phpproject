				  </li>
				  <p>Bako National Park is a popular tourist attraction in Malaysia for travelers who enjoy the great outdoors. Located in <font color="blue">Sarawak</font> state on Borneo, it’s not very big but packs a wallop for its size. Travelers can see wildlife, rainforests, tumbling waterfalls, beaches and sea stacks. The biggest attraction in the park is the bizarre, obscene-nosed proboscis monkey, though they are rare and difficult to spot. It also has great nature trails, from easy strolls to full-day hikes through the jungle, so all visitors should be able to find one that suits them.</p>
                  <li><h4>Taman Negara</h4>
				  <img src = "images/taman.jpg" alt = "taman image" width = "70%" height = "70%">

Taman Negara is a haven for endangered species such as the Asian elephant, tigers, leopards and rhinos, but numbers are low and sightings are very rare. It’s unlikely that you will see anything more than birds, small deer, lizards, snakes and perhaps a tapir.</p>
